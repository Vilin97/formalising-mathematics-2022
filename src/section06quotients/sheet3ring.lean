## Maps X → X → X

We're trying to make `Zmod37` into an additive group; we've defined
the additive unit `0` and additive inverse `-`; we still need to 
define the group law `+` though. The type of `+` will be
`Zmod37 → Zmod37 → Zmod37` and this might look a bit weird, so let
me just spell it out. We usually think of addition as a function
which eats two elements of an additive group `G` and returns another
element. But here what we're going to do is to think of addition
as a function `g + _` which eats *one* element `g` and returns a
function `G → G`, namely the function which adds `g` to its input.
With this way of thinking about it, addition is a function
from `Zmod37` to the type of functions from `Zmod37` to `Zmod37`,
and this latter type is called `Zmod37 → Zmod37`. So, putting
it all together, addition has type `Zmod37 → (Zmod37 → Zmod37)`,
and because `→` is right associative in Lean we can write this
as `Zmod37 → Zmod37 → Zmod37` (indeed, that's what "right associative" means).

-- We define addition using a function in the library called `quotient.map₂`
-- which will descend a term of type `ℤ → ℤ → ℤ` to a term of type
-- `Zmod37 → Zmod37 → Zmod37`. We descend addition on the integers.
-- To make this work (to check it's a "well-defined definition") we need to prove
-- a theorem, hence this starts as a definition and ends up as a proof of a theorem.

## `quotient.induction_on`

The one thing I've not told you about is a really nice way of 
reducing questions about `Zmod37` to equations about integers.
Sure you can use `surjective_quotient_mk` but there's a much
nicer way; you can do "induction on the terms of the quotient".
Let me do this first one for you, to give you the idea of
how to do these simply.

  -- A question about Zmod37, a type we're in the middle of building
  -- an API for.
  apply quotient.induction_on z,
  clear z,
  -- Still a question about Zmod37, but now all our variables
  -- are integers,
  intro a,
  -- There are now two approaches. You can either `apply quotient.sound`
  -- to turn it into a question about integers, where we can use
  -- all the usual tactics like `ring`, or you can see how far
  -- the simplifier gets, because we've been training it to
  -- do questions like these.
  -- We told it `0 = ⟦0⟧` and `⟦a⟧ + ⟦b⟧ = ⟦a + b⟧`.
  -- In this case, the simplifier can do it.
  simp,
  -- If it can't do it, try applying `quotient.sound` and
  -- then perhaps `dsimp` to get rid of the lambdas.
end

-- I'll give you the first line for this one.

begin
  apply quotient.induction_on₂ y z, clear y z,
  intros a b,
